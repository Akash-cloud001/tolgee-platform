Dice Workout App
Problem Statement

The Dice Workout App is a simple web application designed to create spontaneous workout routines. Users roll a virtual dice, and each face of the dice represents a different exercise, such as push-ups, sit-ups, or squats. This interactive app generates a randomized workout routine, making it perfect for users looking for a fun and engaging way to stay active.
Tech Stack

    React: For building the user interface.
    Material UI: For styling and responsive design.
    react-three-fiber: To create a 3D dice rolling experience.
    Tolgee: For multilingual support and localization.

Approach

    Landing Page: The app opens with a landing page that provides users with an overview of its features and functionality. A navigation bar includes a language switcher for accessibility.

    Game Screen: Upon starting the game, the user is presented with three main components:
        Challenge Description: This section outlines the different exercises available.
        Dice Roller: A visually engaging interface for rolling the dice.
        Dice Result Display: This area shows the result of the latest dice roll.

    Generating Challenges: As users roll the dice, a list of challenges is dynamically generated in the challenge section. Each entry includes the name of the exercise, the number of sets to perform, and a tutorial video link for guidance.

    Complete Workout Routine: After the user rolls the dice for all exercises, a comprehensive workout routine is compiled and displayed in a randomized order. A "Restart" button allows users to initiate a new game easily.
